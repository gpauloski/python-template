# Tests for foobar

Test files should take the form `*_test.py` and tests inside files should be top-level functions named `test_*()`.

Tests should typically:
- test a single aspect of the code (e.g., to test feature `a` and `b`, use two separate test functions),
- only test the interface (e.g., tests should not check internal implementation details), and
- tests should not rely on the order in which they are executed.
